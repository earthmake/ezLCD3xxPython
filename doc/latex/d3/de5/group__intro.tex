The way the ez\-L\-C\-D works \-:\par
 Commands are sent to the ez\-L\-C\-D though the serial interface, Commands are text based and end with a carrage return {\bfseries cr}.\par
 So if you send {\bfseries cls} ending with a {\bfseries cr} the device will clear the screen and return a {\bfseries cr} when the command is complete,\par
 some widgets take a bit of time to complete so after sending a command allways wait for a {\bfseries cr} to comeback before sending another command.\par
